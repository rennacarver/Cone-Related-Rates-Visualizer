## Features

- Get comfortable with how formulas connect variables
- Connect the rates of those variables as time passes
- Modify the dimensions of the cone to see how the variables and rates are affected
- Light and Dark Theme

## Lessons Learned

- AI gets it wrong a lot but is a wonderful tool for learning a new framework, fixing small bugs, looking up documentation, and building small components
- AI is not always great with architecture but is great for small details
- Not all probjects need a framework like React or Angular
- Adding floating point numbers increases the complexity of the project and bugs 10x
- Intrinsic design for CSS requires a lot less media queiries keeping the code clean and simple

## Future Enhancements

- Detect user's system theme for default behavior
- Add constant volume option
- Add graph of rates as they change (derivative graph)
- Add additional shapes
- Allow user to change the liquid that fills the container

## Fixes

- The rates don't show when the animation is paused or the slider is manually moved
- The animation slider can glitch when moved to 0
